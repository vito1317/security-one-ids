## 2024-05-15 - [Unauthenticated Endpoints Executing Shell Commands]
**Vulnerability:** Several endpoints in `routes/api.php` (`/api/system/update`, `/api/system/version`, `/api/system/restart`, `/api/rules/update`) exposed functionality to trigger OS-level commands (like `git pull` or `supervisorctl restart all`) completely unauthenticated. Authentication was only applied inline within one specific route (`/api/settings/sync`).
**Learning:** Due to a lack of shared middleware for the `api` route group, new API endpoints were added sequentially without considering global authentication. Security logic was duplicated and omitted on dangerous operational endpoints.
**Prevention:** Implement group-level authentication middleware for related protected endpoints. Ensure that all routes executing high-privilege operations or modifying global state require strict authentication tokens. Avoid applying authentication only inside route closures where it can be easily missed on subsequent additions.

## 2025-02-28 - Insecure Token Comparison (Timing Attack)
**Vulnerability:** API routes protecting agent updates and settings were secured with `!==` string comparison on `AGENT_TOKEN`, which opens a side-channel for timing attacks.
**Learning:** Checking secure tokens with standard operators (`==` or `===`) stops comparison on the first mismatched character, leading to timing variations that can be measured and exploited to extract a token.
**Prevention:** Always use `hash_equals()` for token or password verification and cast values to strings beforehand.
