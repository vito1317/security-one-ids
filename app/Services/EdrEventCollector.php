     *
     *  - **No `uid`.** Identity on Windows is a SID, and the sensor reports
     *    the account name directly. The generic path would read a missing
     *    `uid` as -1 and then resolve it through a user map that is empty by
     *    design, so every event would be attributed to nobody — and the actor
     *    key, which is built from the uid, would collapse every account on the
     *    host into one actor.
     *  - **No `ntime`.** The timestamp is already wall clock. The generic path
     *    would see a zero and fall back to the flush time, discarding a
     *    per-event clock that is right there and stamping whole batches with
     *    one value.
     *  - **`parent_pid`, not `parent`.** A missing parent is a zero, and a
     *    zero parent breaks lineage silently: every process becomes an orphan,
     *    every orphan gets its own actor, and the correlator sees a host on
     *    which nothing is ever descended from anything.
     *  - **`type`, not `syscall`.** ProcessStop rows are not executions and
     *    would otherwise be counted as such, roughly doubling the exec volume
     *    and inventing a second launch for every process that ever exits.
